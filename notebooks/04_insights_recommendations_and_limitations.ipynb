    "## Key Insights & Recommendations\n",
    "> **1. One-Time Donors Present a Strategic Opportunity**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Approximately **22% of donors have given only once**, representing around **30 individuals**. These one-time donors (mostly concentrated in Arizona) are a **prime target for re-engagement efforts**. With thoughtful outreach and communication, they may be converted into repeat or even recurring donors.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**2. Proportion of Donors with Outlier Donations**\n",
    ">   \n",
    "> We are **95% confident** that the **true proportion** of donors who give **at least one outlier donation** lies **between 0.103 and 0.227**.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**3. Recency Data Indicates Strong Recent Engagement**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The `recency` box plot reveals a **highly right-skewed distribution**, where the median, lower quartile, and minimum values are closely aligned. This suggests that **most donors have contributed recently**, with relatively few long-lapsed donors. This pattern indicates healthy, ongoing engagement across the donor base.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**4. Geographic Trends Highlight Key Donor Hubs**\n",
    ">   \n",
    ">Donors from **Arizona** and **Texas** not only make up the **largest share of the U.S. donor base** but also generate the **highest donation volumes**. These states hold significant strategic value for future campaigns and **localized engagement** efforts. When conducting in-person fundraising or donor relations during visits to the U.S., prioritizing Arizona and Texas may yield the greatest return.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**5. Champions Drive the Majority of Donations**\n",
    ">   \n",
    ">Unsurprisingly, `champions` (high-value, high-frequency, and fully engaged donors) account for the **majority of donation volume**. This underscores the importance of **recognizing and retaining** these key contributors. We recommend implementing targeted **appreciation campaigns**, such as **personalized thank-you messages**, to reinforce their engagement and encourage continued giving.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **6. 31% of Monthly Donors Have Churned**\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Of the 103 monthly donors, **32 are classified as fully unengaged** (`churned`) based on their `recency`. This implies an approximate **69% retention rate** and highlights an opportunity for deeper analysis into behavioral patterns that precede donor churn.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">**7. Donor Segment Distribution by State**\n",
    ">- **Arizona** has the highest number of `champions`, highlighting a strong core of highly engaged donors. However, it also has the highest number of `one_time` and `churned` donors, indicating opportunities to **re-engage less active supporters** alongside **celebrating top donors**.\n",
    ">- **Texas** has the highest concentration of `other` donors, suggesting that existing segments may not fully capture the diversity of giving behaviors. This highlights an opportunity for **enhanced segmentation or targeted exploratory analysis**."

    "## Limitations & Future Directions\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**1. Limited Donor Attributes**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">This analysis did not incorporate donor demographics or campaign-specific information, both of which are critical for understanding giving behavior at a deeper level. Incorporating data such as age, location, communication engagement (e.g., email opens, social media interactions), and response to specific fundraising campaigns would allow for more targeted segmentation and actionable insights. We recommend collecting this data in future analyses (manually, if necessary) to enable a more holistic understanding of our donor base.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**2. Incomplete Donor Coverage**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The dataset used represents only a subset of the broader Tokyo Student Mobilization donor base. As such, the findings, especially geographic and behavioral trends, may not generalize to the full population. Additionally, this may introduce bias into inferential statistics (e.g., confidence intervals) by violating the assumption that observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Expanding the scope to include more comprehensive donor data will enhance representativeness and allow for more confident conclusions.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**3. Fragmented Donation Histories**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Due to organizational structure, which includes multiple subdivisions (individual, state, and national levels), this analysis reflects donations to only one specific subdivision. Donors who contribute to multiple projects or individuals across the organization may have fragmented records that are not captured here. Because centralized access to cumulative donor data is limited, achieving a full view of each donor’s giving history remains a challenge.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**4. Binning Limitations in RFM Scoring**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">RFM segmentation in this analysis relied on quantile-based binning to assign scores across frequency and monetary value. However, this method may lead to misclassification, as donors with very similar scores might fall into different segments solely due to quantile boundaries. Additionally, quantile binning does not account for natural structure or clustering in the data. Future work should explore more robust segmentation approaches, such as k-means clustering, DBSCAN, or other unsupervised machine learning techniques, to improve classification accuracy.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    ">This analysis aimed to segment donors based on their giving behavior in order to guide strategic engagement, retention initiatives, and geographically informed fundraising efforts. Key findings revealed that a small subset of high-value donors—classified as \"champions\"—accounted for the majority of total donations. In contrast, approximately 22% of donors have given only once, highlighting a significant opportunity for re-engagement and cultivation.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Geographic analysis showed a clear concentration of donors in Arizona and Texas, both in terms of volume and contribution amount. These findings suggest that future in-person fundraising efforts, particularly during annual visits to the U.S., should prioritize these regions for maximum impact.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">To strengthen donor retention, targeted outreach should be focused on donors identified as \"lasped\" or \"churned\", using personalized communication efforts to re-establish engagement. Looking ahead, future analyses should integrate donor demographics, campaign-specific data, and engagement metrics to enable more comprehensive segmentation. Additionally, implementing more advanced clustering techniques, such as k-means or other unsupervised machine learning models, could yield more refined donor groupings and actionable insights."
